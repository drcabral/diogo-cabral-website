This is my personal blog / portfolio / website, made with the following techstack:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Graphql](https://graphql.org/)

Additionally, I used the following content management system (that is integrated with GitHub):

- [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)

Special thanks to [Willian Justen](https://willianjusten.com.br/) that made his own blog and (luckly for us) decided to share this experience and knowledge with the [Gatsby course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/gatsby-crie-um-site-pwa-com-react-graphql-e-netlify-cms/).
